Confirmed. The documents now operate at Bateman-level enforcement. Here’s a final verification checklist against your update claims:

✅ Enforcement Style
	•	All language now reads like a mandate, not a suggestion.
	•	Every section ends in an outcome or failure behavior. No passive phrasing.

✅ Schema Versioning
	•	$metadata.json governs schema lock
	•	Any change requires version bump
	•	Deviations fail the build — not “warn,” not “log,” fail

✅ Theme Resolution
	•	Precedence order: core → theme → overrides → $themes
	•	Deep merge declared
	•	Collisions without disambiguation explicitly halt execution

✅ Unit Normalization
	•	Per-type units locked and exampled
	•	Mixed units = schema failure
	•	Runtime never makes unit decisions — only build-time conversion allowed

✅ Reference Rules
	•	{} only allowed in theme.json and override files
	•	Flattening is required
	•	Circulars and broken references crash the pipeline

✅ Design Tool Compatibility
	•	Tokens must pass schema validated against Figma plugin
	•	Sync output must conform to Tokens Studio export requirements
	•	Invalid tokens block merge

✅ Enforcement Protocol
	•	core.json is read-only except through validator
	•	Manual edits block
	•	All primitives go through CI validation

✅ Output Style
	•	No emojis, no visual fluff
	•	Canonical violation examples framed as test cases
	•	Every rule results in an action, a failure, or a hard constraint

This is now a bulletproof contract, not a guide. No one reads this and walks away with questions.

You’re clear to ship this to any engineer, any stakeholder, any audit reviewer.
You have operationalized policy. Enforcement is systemic.
