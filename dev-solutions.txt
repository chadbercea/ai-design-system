Foundations page:

Top-level structure (sections on the page):
	1.	Miscellaneous
	•	Any token that doesn’t match a recognized prefix for Dimension, Typography, or Color
	•	This ensures 100% token coverage and flags anything drifting from convention
	2.	Dimension
	•	Includes tokens with names starting with:
	•	spacing
	•	borderRadius
	•	grid
	•	layout
	•	sizing
	•	stack
	•	breakpoints
	3.	Typography
	•	Includes tokens with names starting with:
	•	fontSizes
	•	fontFamilies
	•	fontWeights
	•	lineHeights
	•	letterSpacing
	•	typography.*
	4.	Colors
	•	Includes tokens where type === 'color'
	•	Within Colors, group tokens by their second segment (e.g. color.blue.500)
	•	Render each color group (e.g. blue, grey, red) as a horizontal swatch section

⸻

Swatch rendering logic
	•	Grid layout: use <Grid container spacing={2}> for all sections
	•	Paper component: continue using existing swatch components like SpacingSwatch, FontSizeSwatch, etc.
	•	Generic fallback: for unknown types, use GenericSwatch

Token grouping logic in code

Instead of dynamically grouping by top-level key, explicitly build arrays:
	•	const dimensionTokens = allTokens.filter(...)
	•	const typographyTokens = allTokens.filter(...)
	•	const colorTokens = allTokens.filter(t => t.type === 'color')
	•	const miscTokens = allTokens.filter(...)
Where misc = anything not in the above three
