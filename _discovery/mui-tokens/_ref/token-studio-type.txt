Token Types in Tokens Studio
The type is the anatomic part of a Design Token that defines the category of design property the decision belongs to, or when it can be applied.  

You might recall from our Intro to Design Tokens Guide that the type determines what Values are acceptable. 


In this infographic, the Token examples on the right side highlight the Type. Both code blocks have coloras the Token Type.
Tokens Studio (TS) supports 24 unique Token Types. 

Before you jump into the technical docs for each Token Type, you may want to review the common terms and concepts below that will help strengthen your knowledge.

Common Terms
These terms are not the only way to describe Token Types; they are the labels the Tokens Studio team uses for simplicity across our documentation. 

If your team uses different descriptive terms, that's totally okay!

Official

Official Token Types are listed in the W3C Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) Specifications for Design Tokens

For example, Dimension Token is an official type.

Unofficial

Unofficial Token Types were created by Tokens Studio before the W3C DTCG Specs defined an alternate Token Type.

For example, Border Width Token is an unofficial type defined by the spec as a Dimension Token.

Tokens Studio will continue to support unofficial Token Types for now. We've already built a conversion into our SD-transforms script; more details are below ↓.

Any Token Types we are planning to deprecate will be listed as legacy.

Composite

When elements are styled by composing many related design decisions together, they are combined into a Composite Token Type.

For example, a Typography Token is composed of 9 independent text-related properties.

Property

Each design decision that is a part of the Composite Token is referred to as a property of their respective Composite Token in our guides.

For example, fontFamilies and fontWeightsare unofficial Tokens we created to independently define the properties that Compose a typography Token. 

They may be included in the DTCG Specifications in the future, in which case they would be official property Tokens.

Compatible

A Token Type with properties that is compatible with another Token Type. 

For example, the dimension Token Type is compatible with fontSize when referenced within a typography Composite Token.

Compatible Token Types are visible by default when defining Token Values which reference another Token in the plugin. This becomes important when creating and maintaining Tokens in the plugin.

Token Values with References
Working with Token Types
In the Plugin, you select which Type of Token you'd like to create using a no-code interface. Under the hood, Tokens Studio will write the Token as properly formatted JSON files so they can be used in code.  


The Tokens page of the Tokens Studio Plugin shows all Token Types supported. The list is quite long, so the page is scrolled and shown side-by-side to capture them all. 
You might recall that Design Tokens are platform agnostic, written in a common language so they can shared across different tools and technologies. 

This means that engineers working with Design Tokens have to transform them from JSON files into whatever specific programming needs they have before they can work with them. 


The Geko in this infographic represents Style Dictionary.
Transforming Tokens 
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with Style Dictionary, which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: @Tokens-studio/sd-transforms, an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary.

Some Tokens we create in Tokens Studio (TS) have subtle differences in how the Token type is written compared to the DTCG specifications. In the case of unofficial Token Types, which don't exist in the DTCG spec, we have to transform the TS Type into something Style Dictionary is prepared to work with.

The SD-Transforms package's preprocessor will transform the TS Token Type to the Style Dictionary Type, as described in the table below.

**Notes:**
- Use the most specific $type available for each token.
- For atomic typography, use fontFamilies, fontWeights, fontSize, lineHeight, letterSpacing, etc.
- For composite typography, use $type: "typography" and provide all properties in $value.
- For spacing, sizing, borderRadius, etc., prefer $type: "dimension" unless otherwise required.
- Always check the latest Tokens Studio and W3C DTCG documentation for updates.
