Input:
Read MUI tokens from w3c-tokens.json or mui-tokens-raw.json.
Output:
Write a new tokens-studio.json file with the following structure:

- Top-level key is "MUI" (or other set name).
- Categories are direct children of "MUI", camelCase, singular, never pluralized or wrapped.
- Each token is a direct child of its category, with a semantic name.
- Each token object has at least $type and $value, and includes $description if present.
- No extra wrapping, no forced/empty categories, no arrays unless required by the spec.
- If a MUI token does not exist in the output structure, add it as a new token, following the same structure rules.

Rules:
1. No wrappers, no pluralization, no extra nesting.
2. $description is included if present.
3. Set name is always "MUI" (unless otherwise specified).
4. Category names are camelCase, singular, and never pluralized.
5. Token names are semantic and meaningful.
6. $type must match the category (e.g., color, dimension, borderRadius, boxShadow, opacity, typography, etc.).
7. Only include categories and tokens that are present and needed. Do not add empty categories or tokens.
8. Use references with curly braces and dot notation if needed (e.g., {palette.primary.main}).
9. Validate output against the structure reference file.

Checklist for Script Validation:
- [ ] All categories are direct children of the set.
- [ ] All tokens are direct children of their category.
- [ ] No extra wrappers, arrays, or pluralization.
- [ ] All tokens have $type and $value.
- [ ] $description is included if present.
- [ ] No empty categories or tokens.
- [ ] Output matches the latest structure reference.

Action Plan
Update the reference file to explicitly prohibit category nesting.
Refactor the script to:
Flatten all tokens to be direct children of the set.
Ensure each token has a $type.
Remove all category/grouping logic.
