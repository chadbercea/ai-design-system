Input:
Read MUI tokens from w3c-tokens.json.
Output:
Write a new tokens-studio.json file with the following structure:
Top-level key is "MUI".
Categories are direct children of "MUI", camelCase, never pluralized or wrapped.
Each token is a direct child of its category, with a semantic name.
Each token object has at least $type and $value, and includes $description if present.
No extra wrapping, no forced/empty categories, no arrays unless required by the spec.
If a MUI token does not exist in the output structure, add it as a new token, following the same structure rules.
Rules:
No wrappers, no pluralization, no extra nesting.
$description is included if present.
Set name is always "MUI".
If in doubt, compare output to the structure reference file.
